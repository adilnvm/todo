# React ToDo App (No Build Tools)

## 🌍 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This Mini-Project is Live on:

>_[https://adilnvm.github.io/todo/](https://adilnvm.github.io/todo/)_


A simple ToDo list app built with **React 18**, **TailwindCSS**, and **localStorage**.  
This project does **not** use build tools like Webpack, Vite, or Create React App.  
Instead, it loads React and Babel directly from a CDN for quick setup and deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add tasks with a description and optional due date  
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete  
- Edit or remove tasks  
- Tasks are saved to **localStorage** (persistent across refreshes)  
- Responsive UI with TailwindCSS
